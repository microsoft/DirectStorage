/**
 * ZstdGpuDecompressSequences_SingleStream_LdsFseCache32.hlsl
 *
 * A compute shader that decompresses single FSE-compressed sequences stream per TG by preloading
 * FSE tables into LDS and then sampling FSE tables from LDS for faster access comparing to L0/Scalar cache.
 *
 * The variant targeting hardware with maximal supported wave size of 32 lanes.
